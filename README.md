  -  **To use Auto Trades** u need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.0/node-v18.16.0-x64.msi "https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.0/node-v18.16.0-x64.msi")

  - If you run into the updating CSGO, login without sandbox. It should make the update box go away.
  -  Make sure Steam is being ran as Admin, in Sandbox and under Windows 7.
  -  If you can't run over 5 clients, you may need a different port than 27015 on the server. 
  -  If you can't run over 13 clients, you may need to add virtual adapters either from vmware or hyperv.
  -  Recommend using BES - Battle Encoder Shirase - Set CSGO to 50%, GameOverlayUI to 50% on watch.
